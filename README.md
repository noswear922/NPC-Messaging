# NPC Messaging Script for GTA V RP

This script enables players to send messages to a Discord webhook through interactions with NPCs (non-playable characters) in GTA V roleplay servers using FiveM. It is designed to be used for businesses or various jobs within the game.

## Features

- **Message Sending**: Allows players to send messages to a Discord webhook via NPC interactions.
- **Automatic Character Info Retrieval**: Automatically retrieves character information such as names and phone numbers.
- **Message Input Field**: Provides a field for players to enter their message when interacting with an NPC.

## How It Works

1. **NPC Setup**: NPCs are created with specified models and placed at designated locations in the game.
2. **Interaction**: When players interact with an NPC, the script retrieves their character information and displays an input dialog.
3. **Message Submission**: Players can enter a message in the dialog box, which is then sent to a specified Discord webhook along with the character information.

## Script Status

- **Work In Progress (WIP)**: This script is currently in development and will be updated with more features and improvements in the future.
- **Feedback**: As this is my first script, I welcome any feedback or suggestions to help improve it.

## Dependencies

- `ox_target`: For NPC interaction targeting.
- `ox_lib`: For displaying input dialogs.

## Installation

1. Add this script to your `resources` folder.
2. Ensure `ox_target` and `ox_lib` are also added to your server.
3. Start the script in your `server.cfg` or appropriate configuration file.
